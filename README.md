# MKS22X-FinalProject
DAY 1:
Connor:
Started the item class and the entity class
Tested a possible move method which lagged a bit but was able to move left and right
Attempted at displaying animations of an item; failed and needed to look up example

DAY 2:
Connor:
Got items to finally display after creating an animation class but had problems with the item copying over itself

DAY 3:
Connor:
Figured out that the background command needs to be called after each animation but two animations can't be shown at the same 
time
Made the entity constructor and its display method
Finally got the character to move around 

DAY 4:
Connor:
Worked on smoothing out the animations so the character doesn't moonwalk. Realized that the character keeps walking once 
stopped.
Helped Samson with rooms as Samson coded and Connor watched and spotted out errors.

DAY 5:
Connor:
Fixed the issue of two animations not being able to be shown
Realized that entities and items should have stored x and y values and have helper methods to alter and use those two floats
Working on a buffer for the keyboard

DAY 6:
Connor:
Worked and failed at buffer after trying so many methods like serials and stringbuffer, going to ask Mr. K the next day.
Also gave the entities more helper methods to access instance variables

DAY 7:
Connor:
Got the buffer to work and the Player can now walk, run, and pick up items and store it in its inventory

DAY 8:
Connor:
Worked on displaying the HUD with the health, armor, and worked on the inventory display. Scrolling through the inventory is 
giving problems

DAY 9:
Connor:
